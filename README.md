JSON Model
# The JSON model is a client-side model and, therefore, intended for small data sets, which are completely available on the client. The JSON model does not support mechanisms for server-based paging or loading of deltas. It supports, however, two-way binding. Also, client-side models like the JSON model have no built-in support for sending data back to the server. The apps have to use, for example, model.getData() and jQuery.ajax() to send updated data to the server.
